# Harri.SchoolDemoAPI.BlazorWASM - Blazor Admin UI

**Harri.SchoolDemoAPI.BlazorWASM** is a standalone Blazor WebAssembly Admin UI built with MudBlazor for managing students, schools, and applications, featuring comprehensive automation tests and CI/CD integration. 

The backend .NET 8 REST API is a separate project here: [Harri.SchoolDemoAPI](https://github.com/HarrisonSlater/Harri.SchoolDemoAPI)

## ðŸš§ Work In Progress - UI
So far the students pages are complete with in-depth Bunit and Playwright tests covering the implemented functionality

# Running the app
To point to a local Harri.SchoolDemoAPI instance:

1. Set `StudentDemoAPIUrl` in [`wwwroot/appsettings.json`](/src/Harri.SchoolDemoAPI.BlazorWASM/wwwroot/appsettings.json) (defaults to `http://localhost:8080`).
2. Ensure the backend API and database is running (see [running from container instructions](https://github.com/HarrisonSlater/Harri.SchoolDemoAPI#running-from-container)).
3. From the project root:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project src/Harri.SchoolDemoAPI.BlazorWASM/Harri.SchoolDemoAPI.BlazorWASM.csproj
   ```
